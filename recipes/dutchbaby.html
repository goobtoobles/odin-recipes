    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A Dutch Baby is a large, eggy pancake that you bake in the oven. It is typically a breakfast food, although having it for brunch is ok, too. Some people call it a Bismarck, but I don't. I think it's way more fun to say "I'm hungry for a Dutch Baby".</p>
    <p>While it would be pretty good without any accoutrements, I highly recommend them. Anything you'd put on a pancake works here, but my favorite is a squeeze of lemon and some powdered sugar. Jam is pretty great, too.</p>
    Another option is to make a savory version, if that's your thing. Just add a little ground black pepper and some herbs or somesuch to the batter. I like this version with ham and greens. Either way, slice it up like a pie to serve. It would be a bit much to eat the whole baby.</p>
